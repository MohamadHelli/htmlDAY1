    <h2>My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme From &quot;Titanic&quot;) Songtext</h2>

    <br>Every night in my dreams<br /> I see you, I feel you<br /> That is how I know you go on<br /> Far across the distance and spaces between us<br /> You have come to show you go on<br />
    <br /> Near, far, wherever you are<br /> I believe that the heart does go on<br /> Once more you open the door<br /> And you&#039;re here in my heart<br /> And my heart will go on and on<br />
    <br />
    <br /> Love can touch us one time<br /> And last for a lifetime<br /> And never let go &#039;til we&#039;re gone<br /> Love was when I loved you<br /> One true time I hold to<br /> In my life we&#039;ll always go on<br />
    <br /> Near, far, wherever you are<br /> I believe that the heart does go on<br /> Once more you open the door<br /> And you&#039;re here in my heart<br /> And my heart will go on and on<br />
    <br /> You&#039;re here, there&#039;s nothing I fear<br /> And I know that my heart will go on<br /> We&#039;ll stay forever this way<br /> You are safe in my heart<br /> And my heart will go on and on
